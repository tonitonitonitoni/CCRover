The small robot has dimensions 100mm wide by 180mm long by 70mm tall, not including the wheels.
The wheels are 65mm in diameter and 25mm thick.
The lidar and camera placement are still unknown but I will use a lidar which is the same size as the wheels and positioned 45mm front of centre.

Still to do: I want to re-do my robot using XACRO, especially to use the inertia macros.
